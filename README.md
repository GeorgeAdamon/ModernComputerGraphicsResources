# ModernComputerGraphicsResources
A collection of blogs, personas and publications that act as reference points for the latest developments in Computer Graphics.

This collection was initiated by George Adamopoulos in November 2018, as a away to collect as many cultural and technological contributions of incredibly talented people as possible, in a handy and accessible place.

This collection was initially biased towards the Unity3d environment and Cg/HLSL shaders, aligning with the author's interests at that time. Hopefully over time it will evolve into a richer, more diverse and more holistic collection of resources.
