* [**Efficient AABB/triangle intersection in C#**](https://stackoverflow.com/a/17503268)  
**Original Question**

  > Can anyone recommend an efficient port to CSharp of any of the public AABB/triangle intersection algorithms.
  >
  > I've been looking at Moller's approach, described abstractly here, and if I were to port it, I would probably start from this C++ version. This C++ library by Mike Vandelay seems like it could also be a great starting point.
  >
  > ...or... any other "wheel" that can take a triangle of Vector3's and tell me if it intersects with an AABB), relatively efficiently.
  >
  > There seem to be a variety of algorithms, but most seem to be written in c++, or just described abstractly in white papers and I need a c# specific implementation for our application. Efficiency is not key, but c# is. (though efficiency is obviously nice too of course ;p )
  >
  > Any C# options, before I wade through a "math" port ;) would be greatly appreciated! Thanks.
