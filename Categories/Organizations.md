Some concrete focus areas are object recognition, human action detection and pixel-level image/video understanding. More broadly, this group is interested in studying strategies for effectively harnessing the human experience to advance artificial intelligence. This includes studying crowd engineering, designing interactive learning algorithms, building human-AI collaborative systems and investigating how cognitive science research can inform AI models._

## [Stanford Computational Vision & Geometry Lab- CVGL](http://cvgl.stanford.edu/publications.html)
_The Computational Vision and Geometry Lab (CVGL) at Stanford is directed by Prof. Silvio Savarese. Its research addresses the theoretical foundations and practical applications of computational vision. Its interest lies in discovering and proposing the fundamental principles, algorithms and implementations for solving high level visual recognition and reconstruction problems such as object and scene understanding as well as human behavior recognition in the complex 3D world._


## [Thoth](https://lear.inrialpes.fr/research.php)
_Thoth is a joint team of Inria and Laboratoire Jean Kuntzmann, and started in January 2016. It is a follow up to the LEAR team (2003-2015).<br/>Thoth is motivated by today's context in which the quantity of digital images and videos available on-line continues to grow at a phenomenal speed. The main objectives of the team are: (i) designing and learning structured models capable of representing this visual information; (ii) learning visual models from minimal supervision or unstructured meta-data; and (iii) large-scale learning and optimization. An additional focus of Thoth is on collection of appropriate datasets and design of accompanying evaluation protocols._
