## [Thoth](https://lear.inrialpes.fr/research.php)
_Thoth is a joint team of Inria and Laboratoire Jean Kuntzmann, and started in January 2016. It is a follow up to the LEAR team (2003-2015).<br/>Thoth is motivated by today's context in which the quantity of digital images and videos available on-line continues to grow at a phenomenal speed. The main objectives of the team are: (i) designing and learning structured models capable of representing this visual information; (ii) learning visual models from minimal supervision or unstructured meta-data; and (iii) large-scale learning and optimization. An additional focus of Thoth is on collection of appropriate datasets and design of accompanying evaluation protocols._
