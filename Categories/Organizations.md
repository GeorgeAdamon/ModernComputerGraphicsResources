# Teams, Labs & Institutions

## [Carnegie Mellon Graphics Lab](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/)
_The Carnegie Mellon Graphics Lab conducts cutting-edge research on computer graphics and computer vision, integrating insights from computer science, robotics, and mechanical engineering._

## [EPFL - Computer Graphics & Geometry Laboratory](https://lgg.epfl.ch/research.php)
_Research at the EPFL Computer Graphics and Geometry Laboratory focuses on efficient representations, scalable data structures, and robust algorithms for digital 3D models. 
<br/>Our goal is to understand fundamental principles of geometric computing and leverage these insights to develop new algorithms and tools for 3D shape analysis, simulation, design, and fabrication. Our research explores the interface of several scientific disciplines, such as mathematics, computer science, materials science, and architecture to facilitate innovative computational design solutions for advanced manufacturing and construction._

## [ETH - Computer Graphics Laboratory](https://graphics.ethz.ch/research/)
_The Computer Graphics Laboratory (cgl) was founded in 1994 by Prof. Markus Gross. Its research is devoted to the design of fundamental methods, algorithms and systems for computer graphics, geometric modeling, physics-based animation, image acquisition and generation, display, scientific visualization, and multimodal learning._

## [Stanford Computational Vision & Geometry Lab- CVGL](http://cvgl.stanford.edu/publications.html)
_The Computational Vision and Geometry Lab (CVGL) at Stanford is directed by Prof. Silvio Savarese. Its research addresses the theoretical foundations and practical applications of computational vision. Its interest lies in discovering and proposing the fundamental principles, algorithms and implementations for solving high level visual recognition and reconstruction problems such as object and scene understanding as well as human behavior recognition in the complex 3D world.

## [Thoth](https://lear.inrialpes.fr/research.php)
_Thoth is a joint team of Inria and Laboratoire Jean Kuntzmann, and started in January 2016. It is a follow up to the LEAR team (2003-2015).<br/>Thoth is motivated by today's context in which the quantity of digital images and videos available on-line continues to grow at a phenomenal speed. The main objectives of the team are: (i) designing and learning structured models capable of representing this visual information; (ii) learning visual models from minimal supervision or unstructured meta-data; and (iii) large-scale learning and optimization. An additional focus of Thoth is on collection of appropriate datasets and design of accompanying evaluation protocols._
